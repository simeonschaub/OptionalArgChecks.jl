This package is currently broken on Julia >=1.5. As this was mostly a demonstrator and I don't really have a concrete use case anymore, I don't currently have plans for fixing this, but please let me know if there is still some interest in this package.

**Warning:** This package is still experimental, and there might be undiscovered bugs. Please open an issue, if you encounter any problems.
